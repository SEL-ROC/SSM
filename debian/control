Description: Manage the state of specific files and packages on a system.
 Simple State Manager (ssm) allows you to define a desired state for
 one or more machines.  This state can include:
 .
 * a complete list of packages to be installed (optional)
 * version information for some or all packages (optional)
 * files that should be in place, and appropriate attributes (optional)
   - regular files (content via md5sum)
   - character, block, and fifo files
   - permissions and ownership
   - soft links and hard links
   - unwanted files and directories (that should be removed)
 .
 If an defined element of a system is not in the desired state, the
 ssm client can fix it, always prompting you before taking action.
 Prompting can be suppressed with a --yes option.
 .
 State information for a machine is kept in a state definition file,
 which can be stored in a location that the ssm client can access via
 http:, https:, ftp:, or on the local filesystem.  State definition 
 files are simple to create, and are easy to read and understand.
